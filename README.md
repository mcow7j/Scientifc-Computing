# Scientific-Computing
Projects undertaken for Scientific Computing Module of Imperial College London. Covers a variety of topics such as sorting algorithms, graph traversal, hashing, recommender systems and infection models.

## Project 1
#### Overview of Part 1: Sort and Searching Algorithms
* Implementation of a hybrid Merge and Selection sort Algorithm along with performance analysis and parameter optimization.
* Implementation of Binary search Algorithm to find a trough in lists along with asymptotic running time analysis. 
#### Overview of Part 2: Working with DNA sequences
* Using Dictionaries to efficiently convert codon strings into Amino Acids, with algorithm performance analysis and discussion.  
* Efficient implementation of Algorithm to find the “aligned” k-mer pairs in “adjacent” DNA sequences (for more info see Project 2 Questions), along with relevant performance analysis with comparison with a Naïve approach. 
* The Algorithm utilises a modified Rabin-Karp method. 

## Project 2

## Project 3 

## Project 4
Includes a review of [The Hidden Geometry of Complex, Network-Driven Contagion Phenomena by Brockmann & Helbing](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1337) with an efficent implementation of it's proprosed infection model and concept of effective distance using between country transport data.

Graph below shows the basic features of the network.
