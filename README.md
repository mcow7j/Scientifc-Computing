# Scientifc-Computing
Projects undertaken for Scientific Computing Module of Imperial College London. Covers a variety of topics such as sorting algorithms and infection models.

## Project 1
Includes a review of an academic paper for an infection model utilising effective distance and an efficient implementation of its proposed infection model using between country transport data.

## Project 2
#### Overview of Part A: Sorts and Searching Algorithms
* Implementation of a hybrid Merge and Selection sort Algorithm along with performance analysis and parameter optimization.
* Implementation of Binary search Algorithm to find a trough in lists along with asymptotic running time analysis. 
#### Overview Part B: Working with DNA sequences
* Using Dictionaries to efficiently convert codon strings into Amino Acids, with algorithm performance analysis and discussion.  
* Efficient implementation of Algorithm to find the “aligned” k-mer pairs in “adjacent” sequences (for more info Question 2 Questions) along with relevant performance analysis with comparison with a Naïve approach. 
* The Algorithm utilises a modified Rabin-Karp method.
